# Dangl.BCF

The Dangl.BCF library provides a basic .Net Standard (compatible with .Net Core and the full .Net framework) library
for working with the buildingSmart [BCF XML](https://github.com/BuildingSMART/BCF-XML)
and [BCF API](https://github.com/BuildingSMART/BCF-API) standards.

This library is still a work in progress. Currently, the XML format is supported in version 2.0 and 2.1. Typed
objects are provided for the API in version 1.0, with support for 2.1 planned.

All official testcases of the BCF Implementers Group are being used for integration tests.
